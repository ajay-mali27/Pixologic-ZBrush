> Description


***I present to you a very powerful program IObit Driver Booster Pro, which has a great popularity among many users. It is especially popular with so-called gamers, and with novice users who do not know how to update the drivers on the computer. At first, novice users do not know what it is to update drivers, but soon they encounter problems such as the game does not run, or some program. Then they search for information and realize that it's all about drivers and start trying to update them.***

**After launching you are waiting for a friendly user interface, which is rich in brushes and palettes, it is they play the most important role here, as they are responsible for sculpting and building the model. Russian version is absent and therefore if you do not understand what it is about, it will be difficult to understand, but other users who already understand in general, what he needs, problems to understand the main features and the principle of operation, will not be difficult. Above the palette bar will be a small "Bar" - there you can view the history of all your operations, it is very useful, always see and understand what is happening. There is an opportunity to get a hint, but again it will be in English, so for those who don't know it is not a salvation. In general, I can recommend to watch a few video tutorials on how to use the program, the settings and capabilities of the program ZBrush a great many, so study the video, understand the basic principles, you can even read the literature and based on this to draw conclusions.**
